# Changelog

Every PR must add an entry under `## Unreleased` in the matching section
(Features / Fixes / Internal improvements) — CI blocks PRs that don't touch
this file. On release, the Unreleased section becomes the release body.

## Unreleased

### Features

### Fixes

- Compatibility with GitButler `but` 0.22.0, which overhauled the CLI: commands now
  use `--json` (was `--format json`), `but commit` takes changes positionally with
  `-b/--branch` for the target branch, `but amend` uses `-t/--target`, and the commit
  result is a flat `{commitId, ...}` object. Requires `but` 0.22.0+.

### Internal improvements

## 2026.7.27.1 - 2026-07-27

### Features

- Rename a commit from the tool window: right-click a commit row → **Rename
  Commit** opens a dialog prefilled with the current message and runs
  `but reword`. ([#6](https://github.com/BartInTheField/gitbutler-jetbrains/issues/6))
- Uncommit from the tool window: right-click a commit row → **Uncommit** runs
  `but uncommit`, moving the commit's changes back into the working tree so
  they can be reassigned to another virtual branch. ([#7](https://github.com/BartInTheField/gitbutler-jetbrains/issues/7))
- Drag-and-drop in the tool window: drag uncommitted changes onto a branch to
  preselect it and open the IDE commit UI with exactly the dragged files
  checked, or onto a commit to amend them into it (`but amend`) after a
  suppressible confirmation; CLI errors (e.g. locked files) surface as
  notifications. ([#5](https://github.com/BartInTheField/gitbutler-jetbrains/issues/5))
- Commits in the tool window expand into the files they changed: double-click
  a file to see its diff for that specific commit, or right-click it →
  **Uncommit File** (`but uncommit <file-in-commit id>`) to move just that
  file's change back to the working tree. Jumping to a commit in the Git Log
  moved from double-click to a **Show in Git Log** context-menu entry.

### Fixes

### Internal improvements

- Migrated the repository to GitHub and rewrote CI from Woodpecker to GitHub
  Actions: `ci.yml` runs the changelog gate and tests on PRs and pushes to
  main, while releases live in a separate manually triggered `release.yml`.

## 2026.7.24.1 - 2026-07-24

### Features
- Workspace tool window gains actions: a **Pull Workspace** toolbar button
  (`but pull`) and a per-branch right-click menu with **Unapply**
  (`but unapply`) and **Push** (`but push`). All run as background tasks with
  success/error balloons and a tree refresh, gated by a single in-flight flag
  so operations never overlap; Pull is disabled outside a GitButler workspace.
  See [docs/tool-window.md](docs/tool-window.md).
- GitButler submenu in the IDE's native Git branch context menu: Apply and
  Unapply the selected branch via `but apply` / `but unapply`. Local branches
  get both actions; remote branches get Apply (by short name, hidden when a
  same-named local branch exists). Works on both the 2025.1 and 2026.1 IDE
  lines. See [docs/git-branch-menu.md](docs/git-branch-menu.md).

### Fixes

### Internal improvements

- Local integration tests no longer silently self-skip with Docker installed:
  the test JVM overrides the IDE-pinned JNA native library (incompatible with
  Testcontainers' JNA) and `docker-java.properties` pins Docker API 1.41 so
  Docker Engine 29+ accepts the client while pre-25 daemons keep working.
- Releases are cut manually instead of on every push to main, and CI gates PRs
  on a CHANGELOG.md entry; the Unreleased section becomes the release body and
  is cut back into the changelog after each release.
